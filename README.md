# Brain Tumor Classification:
Brain tumors are the group of abnormal cells that grow together in the brain. It can be cancerous(malignant) or can also point to nothing(benign).<br>

> Tumor classification is perfomed on 3 different tumors and a healthy brain using CT-scans.<br>

* Meningioma Tumor : Tumor that forms in the meninges(Layers of the brain). Most common type of the tumor.<br>
* Glioma Tumor: Tumor that forms in the brain and spinal cord. It starts in the glial cells of the brain or spine.<br>
* Pituitary tumor: These kind of tumors are formed when there are abnormal growths that develop in our pituitary gland.<br>
* Healthy brain with no abnormalities.<br>

Code is implemented in Jupyter notebook using Keras

# Lung Disease Classification

The coronavirus (COVID-19), which evolved in 2019, has drastically changed the face of humanity. It has had a tremendous effect on daily lives, public health, and the economy. It is essential for the early detection of disease to prevent further spreading. In today's world of technology, combining radiological images with advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques would be a great advantage for accurate and early detection of diseases. Developing autonomous disease detecting systems would even help health workers. In this study, traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning algorithms are used on Chest X-rays. Various machine learning algorithms like SVM, KNN are used. And also implemented and tested performance for the neural network model. <br>

> Classification is perfomed on 4 different types of chest X-ray images (3 diseases and 1 normal)<br>

Diseases:
* Covid <br>
* Pneumonia <br>
* Lung opacity <br>
